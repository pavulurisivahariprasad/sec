There are multiple stories about the origin of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. The Shrimad Bhagvatam states that Shiva emerged from a burning tower when Lord Vishnu and Brahma had an argument. The Shiva Purana states that lord Vishnu originated when lord Shiva rubbed some nectar on his ankle.The Vishnu Purana says that lord Shiva originated from the eyebrows of the lord Vishnu, and that is why lord Shiva is mostly in the meditative state.

Though it seems that there are multiple stories and hence, confusion about the origins of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, but, actually all the stories are true.

There are broadly two reasons for this confusion:-

One is that we do not account for the fact that the Hindu system of time is not linear but cylical in nature!
